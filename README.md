# KQ5 CD Text Patch #

A patch to add text dialogs to the CD release of King's Quest V. This release is also the one distributed by GOG and Steam.

## Overview ##

The 1991 CD release of King's Quest V is unique among Sierra's works in that it has no text dialogs for any of the narration or conversations. For context, the original 1990 Disk release of KQ5 had text boxes. The CD version was Sierra's first attempt at a fully-voiced game, and I suspect the text was removed to make this game flow more like a movie. Later fully-voiced games by Sierra (Space Quest IV, King's Quest VI, Quest for Glory IV and so on) included text dialogs along with the voice acting.

This patch uses the Disk version as a reference to source most of the text content. However, since the voice dialog from the CD is not exactly 1-to-1 with the original, text dialogs in the patch have been updated to match the voiceovers.

## Installation ##

Unpack the zip file into your game directory and run the game. It works with both DOS and ScummVM. However, existing saved games may not be backward compatible.
