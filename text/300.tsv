24	220 5		145	Having found help for Cedric from the hermit, Graham decides it would be best to sail there rather than risk hurting him further by carrying him.			
25	220 6		125	With Cedric quietly moaning from the bottom of the boat, Graham decides it would be best to leave him there and go find help.

29	220 9		45	Graham is not strong enough to push the boat.			
30	220 4		144	Firmly, Graham wedges the softened piece of beeswax into the small hole in the boat's hull. Hopefully, the wax will hold and make her seaworthy.			
31	220 10		37	That won't help Graham with the boat.

33	550 1		40	A large beast lies stunned on the floor.			
34	550 10		69	Through the open doorway, Graham can see the wizard lying in his bed.

44	550 8		48	This would not be a good time to bother Mordack!			
45	550 18		55	It wouldn't be wise for Graham to carry the cat around.			
46	550 19		31	Those claws look awfully sharp.			
47	550 4		34	The empty bag proves useless here.			
48	550 5		9	Too late!			
49	550 6		47	THAT won't help Graham against this huge beast!			
50	550 20		43	It won't sway the cat. Graham's in trouble!			
51	550 21		31	Don't bother the cat with THAT!			
52	550 7		33	This is no time for conversation!			
53	550 9		45	Graham wisely decides to keep his mouth shut.

61	(owl)		57	Impatiently, Cedric watches Graham from the gnomes' roof.

63	(owl)		89	Cedric perches safely on a scrubby bush above the anthill and watches the activity below.			
64	(owl)		47	Cedric perches upon the "Swarthy Hog Inn" sign.

76	202 2		120	Cedric seems to be thinking big thoughts right now, perhaps planning their next move, and so is not in a talkative mood.			
77	202 3		91	Having other things on his mind, Cedric doesn't appear to be in the mood to talk right now.			
78	202 4		125	Cedric seems to be quietly contemplating their current situation, and so is not inclined to indulge in coversation right now.

132	(Main)		26	The pouch is already open.			
133	(Main)		144	Upon opening the locket, Graham sees a portrait of an older couple in regal attire. So as not to damage the picture, he quickly closes it again.			
134	0 25		87	Graham waves Crispin's wand which now pulsates with renewed power, but nothing happens.			
135	0 20		65	Graham gives the wand a good shake, but it only fizzles and dies.

155	(Main)		65	The smelly old fish is much too disgusting for human consumption.			
156	0 21		147	Graham waves Mordack's glowing wand...but nothing happens. Could it be that Crispin was right? That wands only respond to their owner...like a pet?

166	1 10		41	A small well is located near the cottage.			
167	1 11		151	An unusual ornament decorates Crispin's front yard. Crispin being a wizard, it must have some magical significance which Graham could never understand.			
168	1 13		50	A tiny pond adds charm to Crispin's forested home.			
169	1 14		47	A small cellar door is located under the house.			
170	1 16		61	A rustic stone bridge crosses the pond below Crispin's house.			
171	1 7		42	The door to Crispin's house is now locked.			
172	2 3		171	A worn dirt path wanders through a thick wood alive with the sound of many creatures. Between the trees, to the east, Graham can see the outline of a great mountain range.			
173	2 4		60	A large, venomous snake blocks Graham's passage to the east.			
174	(rm002)		97	Graham hits and shakes the tambourine with much ruckus, but finds it doesn't accomplish anything.			
175	2 7		39	That won't convince the snake to leave.			
176	2 5		53	In silence, the large serpent eyes Graham menacingly.			
177	2 0		93	Having entered the warm valley awhile back, Graham has removed his uncomfortably heavy cloak.			
178	(rm002)		83	That wasn't wise, Graham! He who speaks with forked tongue should never be trusted.			
179	(rm003 / rm006)		69	Too bad! Graham's swimming skills were no match for the mighty river.			
180	3 2	#at 50 50	123	The quaint little town of Serenia nestles at the base of a great snowcapped mountain range which rises sharply to the east.			
181	3 3		92	A wild river tumbles down from the eastern mountains and flows swiftly below the small town.			
182	3 4		75	Any journey across the great mountains promises to be very perilous indeed.			
183	3 5		93	A rutted road leads into the town from the west while a smaller path joins it from the north.			
184	3 6		92	A small tributary of the larger river powers an old waterwheel as it flows through the town.			
185	3 7		63	Secure within a small pen, a spotted cow quietly chews her cud.			
186	3 10		52	Cedric waits for Graham just outside the small town.			
187	3 8		82	Unfortunately, the cow doesn't have anything to say. Her mouth is too full of cud.

194	4 10		72	Quaint houses and little shops line the town's main cobblestoned street.			
195	4 11		54	A broken wagon blocks access to a smaller side street.			
196	4 13		64	A prosperous-looking tailorshop occupies the town's main corner.			
197	4 14		53	A small toyshop fronts the town's cobblestone street.			
198	4 15		61	Nearly hidden at the end of the street sits a small shoeshop.			
199	4 16		79	While blocking an alleyway, a frustrated man fixes a broken wheel on his wagon.

207	6 2	#at 10 10 #dispose	81	Suddenly, frantic squeakings alert Graham to a mangy cat chasing a terrified rat.			
208	6 4	#at 10 10	52	The cold river courses swiftly by the town bakehouse			
209	6 5	#at 10 10	67	A rutted, dirt road travels east and west beside the rushing river.			
210	6 6	#at 10 10	49	Thick, multipaned windows surround the bakehouse.			
211	6 7	#at 10 10	61	Graham spies a huge pile of logs to fuel the bakehouse ovens.			
212	6 8	#at 10 10	102	With a fine view of the rushing river, the bakehouse sits a bit out of town along an old, rutted road.

214	6 10	#at 10 10	73	Pouncing, the scroungy cat catches a large, grey rat in its wicked claws.			
215	6 11	#at 10 10	92	Too late! The poor rat is already in the clutches of the wily cat who now runs quickly away.			
216	6 12	#at 10 10	61	Graham could never catch this mangy cat and wouldn't want to.			
217	7 7		104	Graham feels the eyes of many creatures upon him as he follows a meandering path through the thick wood.			
218	7 8		68	In a nearby tree trunk, an old wound has created a perfect birdbath.			
219	7 11		78	Upon a fallen log sits a dashing young prince who looks very sad and confused.			
220	7 14		95	What a wonderful bluebird. It could almost make Graham happy again if it wasn't for his family.			
221	7 9		47	There's nothing in the tree but a little water.			
222	7 12		101	Despite his own troubles, Graham feels sorry for the young man who obviously has troubles of his own.			
223	7 15		38	Graham could never catch the bluebird.			
224	7 13		68	The young prince is too despondent over something to even notice it.			
225	7 17		35	The bluebird doesn't care about it.			
226	7 16		56	The bluebird is too busy taking a bath to answer Graham.			
227	8 6		167	The wide dirt path ends at a crude warning sign placed before an ominous-looking forest. Beyond the sign, the path narrows to nothing more than a root-ensnarled trail.			
228	8 7		63	The sign seems self-explanatory enough: ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!			
229	8 10		110	Beyond the warning sign, the gnarled trees seem to close in, entangling and confusing all who dare enter here.			
230	8 11		69	An old, hollow log lies in a small clearing before the gloomy forest.			
231	8 12		59	The old log doesn't look interesting enough to bother with.			
232	8 13		50	The entrance to the elves' tunnel is left exposed.			
233	9 21		75	A lovely little pond surrounds the base of a beautiful weeping willow tree.			
234	9 22		58	There is a small pond here near the edge of a dark forest.			
235	9 23		68	To the north, Graham can see the gnarly edge of a deep, dark forest.			
236	9 25		170	A graceful weeping willow tree grows beside a small pond created from...her tears? In her branch-like arms she clutches a beautiful harp as a child would a cherished toy.			
237	9 28		56	A beautiful harp lies on the ground near the small pond.			
238	10 17		70	The entrance to the small house is through a crudely-constructed door.			
239	10 20		49	A small, shuttered window fronts the gnome house.			
240	10 22		70	Utilizing fallen logs, a gnome has built himself a little forest home.			
241	10 23		57	A young gnome happily plays with an exquisite marionette.

246	10 15		67	Graham attempts to open the little window but finds it bolted shut.			
247	10 16		65	Graham tries to open the small door but finds it securely locked.			
248	10 21		37	The shuttered window is closed tight.			
249	10 24		40	The marionette belongs to the boy gnome!			
250	10 30		68	The young gnome is more interested in his marionette than in Graham.			
251	10 19		28	The key won't fit this lock.			
252	10 32		42	The young gnome is too bashful to respond.			
253	10 31		96	Graham attempts to speak to the young gnome but the boy seems to be very shy and doesn't answer.			
254	(rm011)		69	Too bad! Graham's swimming skills were no match for the mighty river.			
255	(rm011)		58	Tsk, tsk! Graham should know better than to feed the bear.			
256	(rm011)		51	That wasn't a smart move, Graham! "Bee" seeing you!			
257	11 10		48	The swift river turns sharply to the south here.			
258	11 11		56	A swarm of bees buzz around a hole in a rotted old tree.			
259	11 12		69	It appears the bees have a hive inside the hole of the old dead tree.			
260	11 14		59	Graham notices a huge anthill in the distance to the north.			
261	11 15		74	A large bear seems to be very interested in the honey inside the old tree.			
262			0				
263	11 22		67	Graham notices a large stick lying on the ground near the old tree.			
264	11 8		150	Graham reaches a hand into the beehive and retrieves a very sticky chunk of honeycomb. Wrapping it in a protective piece of cloth, he then pockets it.			
265	11 9		63	Graham bends down and picks up the large stick from the ground.			
266	11 13		94	Graham has already taken a honeycomb. It wouldn't be wise to antagonize the now-friendly bees.			
267	11 16		52	Graham should be very careful around a big old bear!			
268	11 20		50	It would be wise if Graham didn't bother the bees.			
269	11 17		56	The bear is too intent on the honey to listen to Graham.			
270	11 19		33	These aren't very talkative bees.			
271	11 18		41	The bear is more interested in the honey.			
272	11 21		34	The bees could care less about it.			
273	12 1	#at 20 10 #time 7	86	A bully of a dog terrorizes the poor ants as he playfully digs up their large anthill.			
274	12 11		88	A colony of large ants parade up and down a huge anthill built amid some scrubby bushes.			
275	12 15		96	A mangy old dog digs playfully at the huge anthill while the poor ants scurry about frantically.			
276	12 19		55	A gypsy wagon can be seen in the distance to the north.			
277	12 13		60	The ants don't seem to take kindly to uninvited trespassing.			
278	12 16		50	The dog doesn't seem to be a friendly sort at all!			
279	12 14		33	The ants aren't interested in it.			
280	12 18		58	That wouldn't divert the dog's attention from the anthill.			
281	12 12		60	The ants are too busy to engage in conversation with Graham.			
282	12 17		57	The dog is more interested in the anthill than in Graham.			
283	13 9		128	A gypsy wagon is encamped here at the edge of the woods. On the side of the wagon, the words "Fortune Teller" have been painted.			
284	13 10		76	The wagon door looks inviting to those who wish to have their fortunes told.			
285	13 11		68	A large ox, tied to the gypsies' wagon, peacefully munches on grass.			
286	13 15		107	Within the gypsy encampment, Graham notices a tall, burly man who keeps a suspicious eye on him and Cedric.			
287	13 21		94	The dark gypsy man bars Graham's entry into the fortune teller's wagon without proper payment.			
288	13 22		74	A steaming pot of stew bubbles over a small campfire near the gypsy wagon.			
289	13 24		58	Graham notices a grassy clearing at the edge of the woods.			
290	13 25		68	A tambourine lies on the ground near the abandoned gypsy encampment.			
291	13 8		84	Not seeing the tambourine's owner, Graham bends down and rescues it from the ground.			
292	13 12		53	Graham finds the huge beast completely uninteresting.			
293	13 16		56	The burly man keeps a watchful eye on Graham and Cedric.			
294	13 23		62	Obviously, the man wouldn't tolerate Graham taking his supper.			
295	13 13		79	The ox's mouth is too full of grass to even attempt a conversation with Graham!			
296	13 19		57	The sullen man doesn't look like the conversational sort.			
297	13 14		56	The ox is not interested in any of Graham's possessions.			
298	14 0		174	The scraggly bushes of the dry brushland taper off to hot, sandy desert as far as the eye can see to the west. To the east, Graham can see the sparse edge of Serenia's woods.			
299	14 1		98	Beyond the large boulders, Graham can see the dry brushland extending to the north for many miles.			
300	14 2		56	The woods meet the desert here in the scrubby brushland.			
301	14 3		85	A rocky cliff ending in a string of huge boulders blocks further travel to the north.			
302	14 4		88	In the distance to the north, rocky cliffs loom like sentinels across the barren desert.			
303	14 5		41	It looks like something may be after him.			
304			0				
305	15 4		168	All around him, Graham sees nothing but more desert. How much farther can he go on? Thankfully, though, a nearby pool of water can relieve Graham's overwhelming thirst.			
306	15 5		142	The scorching sun burns down on the dry desert as Graham struggles through the hot sand. He looks around, but all he can see is...more desert!			
307	15 6		159	Oh, oh! A picked-clean and sun-bleached skeleton lies in the sand of the hot, dry desert. What happened? Who can say...but it makes Graham uneasy nevertheless.			
308	15 9		52	An old shoe lies, forgotten, near the poor skeleton.			
309	15 10		46	A rope and water basket sit near a small well.			
310	15 12		125	A small oasis! Its tantalizing water, so sparkling in the desert sun! Graham's hot, thirsty body is irresistibly drawn to it.			
311	15 2 / 216 3		104	Ah! Life-giving water! Nectar of the gods! Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him.			
312	15 7		63	Graham can't do much to help the poor man now...and vice versa!			
313	n/a		68	Since Graham has just taken a drink, he's not thirsty at the moment.			
314	15 8		41	Well, it's too late for conversation now!			
315	15 0		88	The hot sun and choking sands are taking their toll on Graham. He must drink...and soon!			
316	15 1	#at 20 20 #dispose	114	Too late! Graham collapses and dies of extreme thirst in the hot desert sun. If only he could have found an oasis!			
317	(rm015)		26	DYING for a drink, Graham?			
318	(rm017)		49	That wasn't a very smart move for Graham to make!			
319	17 1		89	Taking care to be very quiet, Graham reaches out and takes the staff into his possession.			
320	17 4		44	Graham should avoid the bandit at all costs!			
321	17 5		131	Assorted odds and ends clutter the inside of this small tent while upon a lovely carpet sleeps another of the despicable renegades.			
322	17 6		61	Assorted odds and ends clutter the inside of this small tent.			
323	17 2		81	A jeweled staff, leaning against the back of the tent, catches Graham's interest.			
324	17 3		62	Snoring loudly upon a beautiful carpet lies a sleeping bandit.			
325	18 4		57	Near the temple door sits an old, tarnished brass bottle.			
326	18 5		93	A single gold coin, separated from the rest of the treasure, lies on the floor near the door.			
327	18 6		131	Treasure! Treasure piled everywhere! The sparkling brilliance of it overwhelms Graham as he peers around the temple's dim interior.			
328	18 0		76	Bending down, Graham hurriedly picks up the gold coin from the temple floor.			
329	18 2		43	Quickly, Graham grabs the old brass bottle.			
330	18 1	#at 10 10 #dispose	39	Hurry! The exit door is about to close!			
331	(rm018)		69	Cheer up, Graham. At least you can practice your game of tiddlywinks!			
332	18 3		50	Don't waste time! The door may close any time now!			
333	19 0		111	Numerous roots, rocks, and ruts choke the narrow forest path which branches either to the right or to the left.			
334	19 1		143	Ensnarling roots, creeping vines, decaying logs, and twisted, gnarled trees...the close feeling of the gloomy forest quickly overwhelms Graham.			
335	20 0		102	The rocky, rutted footpath staggers its way through the oppressive forest to the north or to the west.			
336	20 1		152	The pervasive gloom of the forest settles around Graham like a tight, suffocating blanket. Everywhere he can hear the eerie sounds of strange creatures.			
337	20 2		68	There seems to be an unusually large number of toads in this forest.			
338	20 3		40	These toads look too repulsive to catch!			
339	21 0		72	Graham tugs firmly at the door in the tree but finds it securely locked.			
340	21 3		84	Reaching in to the little door of the tree, Graham extracts the little golden heart.			
341	21 1		61	Graham finds that the little key fits perfectly in this lock.			
342	21 2		88	Graham is charmed to find a little golden heart inside the door of the twisted old tree.			
343	21 8		32	The little door is already open.			
344	21 9		34	It won't help with the small door.			
345	21 4		83	A slimy path leads from the forest floor up to the base of a large, misshapen tree.			
346	21 5		80	A crude little door has been built into the trunk of this large, grotesque tree.			
347	21 6		86	A small door built into the trunk of a large, twisted tree catches Graham's attention.			
348	21 7		57	There is nothing else inside the little door of the tree.			
349	(rm022)		45	Oh, oh! Watch out for those drop-offs Graham!			
350	22 0		30	The door appears to be locked.			
351			0				
352	22 1		177	A crude, misshapen structure, which remotely resembles a house, sits forlornly in the center of the gloomy forest. A crevasse spewing hot steam and licks of flames surrounds it.			
353	22 2		127	A grotesque bridge of rib-like bones crosses the hot crevasse where a path continues to the front door of the odd little house.			
354	22 3		76	The path seems to dwindle down to nothing as it nears the strange structure.			
355	22 4		82	Spitting hot steam and flames, a deep crevasse surrounds the strange little house.			
356	22 5		38	A small door fronts the odd structure.			
357	22 6		94	The dark forest seems to encase the witch's bizarre little house like a claustrophobic shroud.			
358	23 5		112	A set of stone steps, much to narrow for Graham's larger body, wind precariously upward in the back of the room.			
359	23 7		111	Graham spies a small drawer built into the trunk of a tree which pokes awkwardly through the wall of the house.			
360	23 9		169	The old witch's house has been crudely fashioned from an old tree trunk and salvaged stone. Being cold and creepy, Graham finds he would just as soon hurry up and leave.			
361	23 10		113	Tucked under a large crack in the wall which seems to serve as a window, Graham sees an interesting wooden trunk.			
362	23 0	#at 120 140	59	A small, intricate spinning wheel is put away in the trunk.			
363	23 12		116	An interesting incense burner hangs from a protruding tree branch. Occasionally, from within it, a tiny glint winks.			
364	23 13		66	An interesting incense burner hangs from a protruding tree branch.			
365	23 2	#at 20 140	51	A small leather pouch is tucked away in the drawer.			
366	23 1	#at 90 140	74	Reaching a hand into the trunk, Graham retrieves the small spinning wheel.			
367	23 6		69	The winding steps are much too narrow for Graham to ever fit through.			
368	23 8		40	There is nothing else inside the drawer.			
369	23 11		23	The trunk is now empty.			
370	23 14		32	The incense burner is now empty.			
371	24 11		80	From here, the narrow rocky path leads east and south through the gloomy forest.			
372	24 12		145	Strange plants and animals inhabit this dark and dreary place while thin rays of sunlight barely break the surface of the forest's thick foliage.			
373	24 13		125	Peering curiously at him through the heavy foliage of the dark forest, Graham notices several pairs of bright, blinking eyes.			
374	24 22		44	A sticky puddle of honey lies on the ground.			
375	24 23		62	A large rock-like creature blocks further passage to the west.			
376	24 24		65	Rocky has moved aside to allow Graham passage through the forest.			
377	24 14		89	Graham can plainly SEE the eyes, but he can't quite reach them through the thick foliage.			
378	24 25		55	The rock-like creature is not inclined to move farther.			
379	24 0		94	This situation seems to require very careful thought. Graham needs to spend more time on this.			
380	24 1		250	Graham squeezes the honeycomb as hard as he can, which causes the honey to drip out of it onto the ground creating a sticky little "puddle" at his feet. Now all that's left of the honeycomb is a piece of beeswax, which Graham puts back in his pocket.			
381	24 20		84	Graham decides to wait until he sees a good reason to toss away these fine emeralds.			
382	24 21		73	The small creatures, whoever they are, don't seem to be interested in it.			
383	24 18		26	Graham receives no answer.			
384	24 19		71	Whoever is watching Graham is unwilling to indulge in any conversation.			
385	24 26		28	Rocky isn't talking anymore.			
386	25 0		111	A path, tangled with roots and vines, leads to the north and east through the dense foliage of the dark forest.			
387	25 1		103	Unseen eyes seem to watch Graham as he stumbles confusedly through the thick maze of the gloomy forest.			
388	26 0		93	A root-rutted path stumbles its way east, west, and north through the dark and gloomy forest.			
389	26 1		93	Through the mists of the forest, Graham can barely see a small, house-like form to the north.			
390	26 2		87	The dark forest seems to close in on Graham as he tentatively makes his way through it.			
391	27 9		65	Narrowing to the west, the dirt road widens as it heads eastward.			
392	27 10		57	The brisk river rushes swiftly by the quaint country inn.			
393	27 11		57	A large haystack dominates the area in front of the barn.			
394	27 12		61	An old, uninteresting barn is located behind the country inn.			
395	27 14		83	Just off a rutted dirt road, a country inn overlooks the picturesque rushing river.			
396	27 15		55	Weary travelers can enter through the inn's front door.			
397	27 16		43	This is a side entrance of the country inn.			
398	27 2		24	The side door is locked.			
399	27 13		55	Graham can see an unbreakable padlock on the barn door.			
400	27 3	#at 20 20 #width 270 #dispose	110	Graham watches with surprise as a contingent of ants marches into the haystack and begins to swarm through it.			
401	27 4		87	Carefully, Graham searches through the haystack but doesn't see anything of importance.			
402	27 1		28	The key won't fit this lock.			
403	28 0		72	Finding the kitchen door locked, Graham unlocks it before going outside.			
404	28 1	#at 10 10	54	There is nothing else of interest inside the cupboard.			
405	28 2	#at 10 10	60	Inside the cupboard, Graham sees a large, juicy leg of lamb.			
406	28 4		76	Graham looks around the inn's kitchen and finds it rather sparse and untidy.			
407	28 5		39	It appears that the door leads outside.			
408	28 6		70	The sound of men talking and laughing loudly floats through this door.			
409	28 7		65	In the corner of the room, Graham spies a large kitchen cupboard.			
410	29 0		58	Graham begins to shiver at the sudden drop in temperature.			
411	29 4		0				
412	(rm029)		35	Oh, oh! That last step was a doozy!			
413	29 5		82	An icy, treacherous path skirts the snowy mountainside as it winds its way upward.			
414	29 6		84	Sheer, vertical cliffs plummet dizzyingly downward from the edge of the frozen path.			
415	29 2		76	Graham dons his warm cloak for protection against the freezing mountain air.			
416	29 3		30	Graham needs warmth, not this!			
417	30 0		160	Graham begins to shiver violently at the extreme cold of these upper reaches while his hands and face begin to numb. He can barely muster the strength to go on.			
418	30 1		99	Graham notices his stomach beginning to rumble with hunger from the exertion of the mountain climb.			
419	(rm030)		52	Well Graham, how does it feel to be a "Pop"...sicle?			
420			0				
421	30 6		142	A frozen waterfall hinders Graham's progress as in the warmer seasons it had washed away part of the path on which he is currently travelling.			
422	30 7		80	Looking upwards, Graham can see a snowy ledge above the steep cliff next to him.			
423	30 9		82	Graham sees another possible route through the mountains from the ledge above him.			
424	30 10		29	If only he could reach it...!			
425	30 11		86	Graham notices a rock overhang near an upper ledge. A rope hangs precariously from it.			
426	30 12		51	Graham notices a rock overhang near an upper ledge.			
427	30 14		119	The remains of an old tree poke out of the mountainside near an upper ledge. Graham's rope dangles dangerously from it.			
428	30 15		76	The remains of an old tree poke out of the mountainside near an upper ledge.			
429	30 17		54	Graham's rope hangs dangerously from a rocky overhang.			
430	30 18		60	The rope dangles precariously from a protruding tree branch.			
431	30 8		65	The icy cliff is much too steep for Graham to climb without help.			
432	30 13		53	Hmmm. The rocky overhang catches Graham's interest...			
433	30 16		42	Well, the tree branch looks interesting...			
434	(rm030)		30	Whoops! That was a fatal step!			
435	31 3		167	As with the path below, the now-frozen waterfall has also washed away parts of this upper trail which narrowly skirts the mountain edge and then heads off to the east.			
436	31 4		79	Graham can see tempting rock outcroppings protruding from the frozen waterfall.			
437	31 5		83	An old log has fallen precariously across a washed-out portion of the narrow trail.			
438	31 6		67	Graham's rope dangles down from a rocky overhang to the path below.			
439	32 4		70	The snowy path abruptly ends where a gradual slope continues eastward.			
440	32 5		73	The shape of one particular mountaintop seems vaguely familiar to Graham.			
441	32 6		158	Graham can see a breathtaking view of distant snow-covered mountains towering majestically above a beautiful valley with a ribbon of river slicing through it.			
442	32 1		44	It won't help Graham cross the icy crevasse.			
443	(rm032)		69	Well Graham, remember when you turned down that last meal at home...?			
444	32 0		59	Graham's hunger grows acute. Without food, he may soon die.			
445	33 2		85	A snowy path zigzags its way across the top of a narrow ridge toward a deep crevasse.			
446	33 3		56	From here, the path widens and continues on to the east.			
447	33 4		141	A deep crevasse splits the snowy mountain ridge in two while a thin strip of ice crosses it. Unfortunately, it looks too wide to jump across.			
448	33 8		66	In the distance, snowy mountains loom above a lovely river valley.			
449	33 9		84	Graham's sled lies in several broken pieces on the eastern side of the icy crevasse.			
450	33 5		86	Graham thinks about attempting to jump across the crevasse, but wisely chooses not to.			
451	33 10		42	The broken sled is now no good to anybody.			
452	33 6		71	Perhaps with some momentum Graham could use this to cross the crevasse.			
453	33 7		40	It won't help Graham cross the crevasse.			
454	34 9		79	A snowy path leads from the mountain ridge to a mysterious, ice-covered castle.			
455	34 10		77	A castle, buried in snow and ice, perches precariously atop a steep pinnacle.			
456	34 11		120	A shivering eagle perches weakly upon a small rock. Despite his own problems, Graham's heart goes out to the poor thing.			
457	34 12		84	The poor eagle gives Graham a pitiful look. Graham would like to help him...but how?			
458	34 13		31	That won't help the poor eagle.			
459	34 14		72	The eagle appears to be too weak to indulge in any further conversation.			
460	35 8		71	The wolf waits anxiously for Graham, having observed the yeti's demise.			
461	35 12		53	Off in the distance, Graham can see the crystal cave.			
462	35 13		117	Off in the distance, a large cave can be seen. Graham can only assume it to be the Ice Queen's precious crystal cave.			
463	35 14		89	A dangerous, snowy path skirts the edge of a vertical mountainside toward a distant cave.			
464	35 9		115	As the huge wolf keeps a sharp eye on Graham there is little he can do to escape his unfair and dangerous sentence.			
465	35 10		106	Graham, knowing better than to rile the large grey wolf further, now wisely keeps his thoughts to himself.			
466	35 7		114	Graham's duties done, the large grey wolf now sits in silence blocking the passage back to the Ice Queen's palace.			
467	35 11		47	That will do nothing to change the wolf's mind.			
468	35 2		178	The savage grey wolf stubbornly blocks Graham's passage back to the Ice Queen's palace. Graham's only option is to go toward a distant cave...where the dreaded yeti can be found!			
469	35 3		87	The savage grey wolf stubbornly blocks Graham's passage back to the Ice Queen's palace.			
470	(rm036)		57	What an abominable situation Graham has found himself in!

472	36 0		65	A snowy path runs along the front of a glittering crystal cavern.			
473	36 1		106	A narrow ledge ends abruptly at a sheer vertical cliff over which the terrible yeti stumbled to his death.			
474	36 2		116	Through the yawning entrance of the cave, Graham can see many beautiful crystals sparkling and flashing from within.			
475	36 5		22	The yeti! Run, Graham!			
476	36 6		43	Graham could never overpower the huge yeti!			
477	36 3	#dispose	10	Too late!!			
478	36 4		60	That will do nothing to help Graham fight the powerful yeti.			
479	38 2		167	Brilliant crystals flashing and sparkling, and reflecting off the numerous waterfalls, cause Graham to gaze in awe and wondermant at the dazzling spectacle before him.			
480	38 0		85	As strong as he is, even Graham can't break the stubborn crystal with his bare hands.			
481	38 3		91	One especially beautiful crystal catches Graham's notice in the center of the crystal cave.			
482	38 4		114	One particularly brilliant crystal catches Graham's attention among all the other glittering crystals in the cave.			
483	38 1	#at 40 10	172	So very gently, Graham hits the beautiful crystal several times with his hammer until it breaks loose in one piece. He then carefully places it among his other possessions.			
484	38 5		42	It won't help Graham retrieve the crystal.			
485	40 4		71	Within a deep ravine, a swift river courses its way down the mountains.			
486	40 2		61	A twisty path winds confusingly along the rocky mountainside.			
487	40 3		116	A pool of water reflects the blueness of the sky where occasionally a vision of a huge soaring bird can be observed.			
488	40 5		88	A beautiful waterfall cascades down from a vertical cliff, high above the two wanderers.			
489	40 6		94	Cedric looks cold and weary as he dutifully follows Graham across these treacherous mountains.

494	(rm042)		53	Graham ought to know better than to feed the animals!			
495	42 3		51	There is nothing much left of the baby roc's shell.			
496	42 4		67	The huge egg is beginning to crack. This is a bad situation indeed!			
497	42 7		91	Graham can see a gittering gold locket lying among the leaves and sticks of the roc's nest.			
498	42 8		46	Oh, oh! The baby roc looks at Graham hungrily!			
499	42 11		197	Graham finds himself in a terrible situation: dropped painfully in the middle of a huge roc's nest set high on a rocky ledge with no way of climbing down. And now the baby roc eyes Graham hungrily!			
500	42 12		199	Graham finds himself in a terrible situation: dropped painfully in the middle of a huge roc's nest set high on a rocky ledge with no way of climbing down. And, even worse...the roc's egg is hatching!			
501	42 2	#at 64 146	80	Graham rescues a lovely golden locket from the leafy clutches of the roc's nest.			
502	42 5		35	Graham doesn't need a broken shell.			
503	42 6		65	Unfortunately, there is little to be done about the hatching egg.			
504	42 9		49	Graham finds himself in a very helpless position!			
505	42 10		41	That's not going to work with a baby roc!			
506	44 2		142	A narrow strand of beach skirts the bottom of the steep cliffs while the cold water of the ocean seems to cunningly steal what little is left.			
507	44 3		93	A short path, starting from a ledge up the cliffside, winds snakelike down to a narrow beach.			
508	44 4		122	Further up the beach, Graham can see a lovely waterfall cascading down the cliffs into the cold, blue waters of the ocean.			
509	44 5		86	Graham notices a rusty iron bar lying on the sand near the bottom of the winding path.			
510	44 6		42	Graham spies a small boat in the distance.			
511	45 1		61	Jagged rocks surround the waterfall at the base of the cliff.			
512	45 2		134	The narrow beach at the base of the steep, rocky cliff widens here a bit, while a chilly ocean continues to beat relentlessly upon it.			
513	45 3		96	A cascading waterfall, though very beautiful, nevertheless cuts off further travel up the coast.			
514	45 4		76	Unfortunately, the waterfall hinders Graham's progress farther up the coast.			
515	46 7		105	Graham pounds on the door, but he finds it bolted from the inside. He can, however, hear activity within.			
516	46 51		109	A makeshift house, fashioned from the bow of a wrecked ship, occupies the south end of a small, narrow beach.			
517	46 52		42	Graham hasn't been invited into the house.			
518	46 53		126	The ocean's cold water seems to lap hungrily toward the small "ship-house" built against the steep cliffs of the narrow beach.			
519	46 54		139	An old hermit, ancient and fragile-looking, inhabits the makeshift house. It appears he has lived alone on this beach for many, many years.			
520	46 56		64	A crude door has been built into the front of the unusual house.			
521	46 57		64	Graham notices a ship's bell hanging near the door of the house.			
522	46 55		42	The hermit doesn't show an interest in it.			
523			0				
524	47 0		42	Oh no! The water is too cold for swimming!			
525	(rm047)		50	Down, down goes Graham...to the bottom of the sea!			
526			0				
527	47 3		60	Uncertainly, Graham and Cedric sail in the vast, blue ocean.			
528	47 5		78	To the east, as far as the eye can see, Graham can see nothing but more ocean.			
529	47 6		62	Far in the distance, Graham can make out small, rocky islands.			
530	47 8		46	Many jagged rocks stand in the shallow waters.			
531	47 9		57	Graham and Cedric spy an interesting island to the north.			
532	47 7		47	Cedric isn't in the mood to talk at the moment.			
533	48 2		75	The boat seems to be seaworthy enough as it sails through the ocean swells.			
534	48 3		60	Graham is growing very tired from swimming in the icy water.			
535	48 4		171	Within the sheltering waters of a surrounding reef, a craggy island rises abruptly from the sea. Just inside an opening in the reef, Graham can see an inviting little bay.			
536	49 0		59	Cedric is near death. Taking him for a swim could be fatal.			
537	(rm049)		77	Hate to harp on the subject, but Graham was no match for the vicious harpies!			
538	49 5		55	The small sailboat seems to wait faithfully for Graham.			
539	49 6		73	Graham notices a large conch shell lying delicately upon the sandy beach.			
540	49 7		69	A small bay laps gently upon a coarse sand beach of the rocky island.			
541	49 8		101	Through a natural rock arch, Graham can see a sandy path leading farther in to the island's interior.			
542	50 3		74	Graham can see the sandy path wending its way upward through a rocky arch.			
543	50 4		89	From the nearby beach a sandy path continues upward to a high point of the craggy island.			
544	50 5		121	Poor Cedric. Having been seriously wounded by the vicious harpies, he now lies, moaning and in pain, upon the sandy path.			
545	50 7		36	That will do nothing to help Cedric.			
546	51 6		136	An involuntary shiver runs down Graham's spine as an overpowering sense of evil seems to hang over this island like a smothering mantle.			
547	51 7		143	A crude set of stairs has been carved into the rocky cliffs of Mordack's island. Above them, a narrow, winding trail leads on up to his castle.			
548	51 8		152	Although very cold, the waters here are calm due to a protective reef. The small beach, however, is nothing but rocks and coarse, almost gravelly, sand.			
549	51 9		96	Now what?! Graham's boat has been dashed to pieces against the jagged rocks of Mordack's island.			
550	51 11		69	A bit shaken, Cedric anxiously takes stock of their unsure situation.			
551	51 14		67	A dead fish lies on the sand beach at the foot of the rocky stairs.			
552	51 10		124	Unfortunately nothing can be done about the wrecked boat. It appears that Graham and Cedric are stuck here, perhaps forever!			
553	(rm052)		42	Too bad! It looks like the "eyes" have it!			
554	52 2		111	Two monstrous statues with burned out eyes face each other across the narrow trail leading to Mordack's castle.			
555	52 3		123	Two monstrous statues of grotesque, distorted serpents face each other across the narrow trail leading to Mordack's castle.			
556	52 4		116	The giant figures can't be climbed without risking life and limb, and since they are made of stone, can't be harmed.			
557	52 7		77	The narrow, rocky trail leads straight to the front gate of Mordack's castle.			
558	52 8		155	A bizarre castle, seeming to rise up out of the very rocks of the strange island like some sort of grotesque growth, beckons, yet repels, at the same time.			
559	52 1		27	It won't do much good here.			
560	52 6		40	That won't help with the stone serpents.			
561	52 5		32	The stone statues don't respond.			
562	53 3		140	A wide chasm separates the narrow trail from the castle's massive front gate. Graham ponders the situation but can't find a way to solve it.			
563	53 5		115	Graham notices a small stairway leading down to another trail which winds around the left side of Mordack's castle.			
564	53 6		91	The strange castle, so close now, intimidates Graham as it towers threateningly before him.			
565	53 4		146	The chasm between the trail and the front gate of the castle is too wide to jump across. Graham will have to find another way to enter the castle.			
566	54 9	#at 10 10	60	The open grate in the stone platform invites Graham's entry.			
567	54 10	#at 10 10	81	Graham notices a rusted grate embedded into a stone platform of Mordack's castle.			
568	54 14	#at 10 10	39	The iron bar holds up the rusted grate.			
569	54 15	#at 10 10	73	Graham has found a stone platform on the west side of the strange castle.			
570	54 16	#at 10 10	111	The twisted and deformed shapes of the island's rocks seem to grow up out of the very earth like strange weeds.			
571	54 8	#at 10 10	86	Graham tugs hard on the grate but soon finds it's rusted in place and can't be budged.			
572	54 12	#at 10 10	26	The grate is already open.			
573	54 13	#at 10 10	32	That won't help budge the grate.			
574	(rm055)		40	Shouldn't play around with Dink, Graham!			
575	55 4		69	A grotesque creature scurries along the stone walls of the labyrinth.			
576	55 6		93	High above him, Graham sees the hole by which he entered these confusing underground tunnels.			
577	55 8		62	Graham sees the hole through which he exited the dungeon cell.			
578	55 9		66	There is a wooden door here! Perhaps it will lead into the castle.			
579	55 13		128	A huge beast, sporting a fluffy topknot bound in a crude hairpin on top of his head, skulks in one dark corner of the labyrinth.			
580	55 17		74	Graham sees the beast's hairpin lying on the stone floor of the labyrinth.			
581	55 18		116	Graham looks around in terrified confusion as he finds himself in a labyrinth somewhere underneath Mordack's castle.			
582	55 1		78	Graham tries to open the wooden door, but to no avail as it's securely locked.			
583	55 3		66	Graham reaches down and grabs the hairpin off the labyrinth floor.			
584	55 5		56	Graham can't catch the creature... and wouldn't want to!			
585	55 7		87	The hole is much too high for Graham to ever reach. He'll have to find another way out.			
586	55 14		52	Graham should watch his step around this ugly beast!			
587	55 2		193	Graham inserts the hairpin into the door's large keyhole and discovers, to his amazement, that it fits perfectly! Turning it ever so gently, he soon hears a soft click and the door is unlocked!			
588	55 11		29	The door is already unlocked.			
589	55 12		40	That won't work with the labyrinth door.			
590	55 15		41	It makes no impression on the huge beast.			
591	56 2		90	A set of wide steps leads up from the labyrinth door to a pantry off the wizard's kitchen.			
592	56 3		61	Graham can see into the kitchen through the open pantry door.			
593	56 4		92	Graham scans the various items lining the open shelves but doesn't see anything of interest.			
594	56 7		72	A closed cupboard in the corner of the pantry catches Graham's interest.			
595	56 10		51	A bag labeled Peas sits on a shelf in the cupboard.			
596	56 11		63	Graham's eyes fall on a bag of dried peas in the open cupboard.			
597	56 0		65	Inside the cupboard, Graham's eyes fall upon a bag of dried peas.			
598	56 1		72	Reaching into the open cupboard, Graham retrieves the bag of dried peas.			
599	56 5		81	Graham examines the contents of the shelves but doesn't see anything of interest.			
600	56 8		45	There is nothing more of use in the cupboard.			
601	56 9		29	The cupboard is already open.			
602	57 13		83	A fire burns hotly in the fireplace while something in the iron pot boils above it.			
603	57 15		205	Graham surveys Mordack's kitchen in disgust. It is an untidy mishmash of dirty pots, jars with unidentified contents, rags, and assorted junk. Even with all that, Graham can see nothing that interests him.			
604	57 16		160	Princess Cassima (whom Graham now knows to have been stolen by Mordack from the Kingdom of the Green Isles), looks pleased to see him. She smiles in friendship.			
605	57 17		179	A lovely young girl with long black hair, olive skin, and flashing green eyes laboriously scrubs the cold stone floor. Though wearing rags, her beauty nevertheless shines through.			
606	57 18		188	A lovely young girl with long black hair, olive skin, and flashing green eyes cowers, frightened, in the corner of the kitchen. Though wearing rags, her beauty nevertheless shines through.			
607	57 29		65	The doorway goes into a hallway containing an unusual pipe organ.			
608	57 30		34	The doorway leads into the pantry.			
609	57 14		69	The stuff boiling in the pot doesn't look, or smell, very appetizing.			
610	57 19		112	Princess Cassima looks glad to see Graham. Perhaps she feels he can help to get her off of this horrible island.			
611	57 20		88	The young girl endlessly scrubs the hard floor. She doesn't pay any attention to Graham.			
612	57 21		77	The poor girl cowers in the corner. It doesn't appear that she trusts Graham.			
613	57 22		44	That won't help Princess Cassima in any way.			
614	57 23		98	While Princess Cassima busily scrubs the kitchen floor Graham tries to figure out what to do next.			
615	57 24		94	Since the girl seems so frightened, Graham compassionately decides to leave her alone for now.			
616	58 5		8	Not now!			
617	58 0		102	A hideous, yet fascinating pipe organ commands attention as Graham walks through a downstairs hallway.			
618	58 1		86	Two distorted figures of bird-like women flank both sides of the monstrous pipe organ.			
619	58 3		41	This doorway leads back into the kitchen.			
620	58 4		60	Graham can see into a large dining hall through the doorway.			
621	58 2		56	The bizarre figures don't appear to have any use at all.			
622	58 6		115	Graham watches in horrified fascination as the grotesque organ begins to magically play a eerie tune all by itself.			
623			0				
624			0				
625	59 3		71	Statues of strange "birdmen" line the walls of the immense dining hall.			
626	59 5		100	This appears to be the huge dining hall of the castle. Graham wonders who eats here besides Mordack.			
627	59 0		72	A massive dining table has been placed before a large, ornate fireplace.			
628	59 1		59	Graham doesn't see anything interesting with the fireplace.			
629	59 4		70	Graham carefully examines the strange statues but sees nothing of use.			
630	59 6		52	Graham isn't interested in sitting around right now.			
631	60 0		92	A huge dining table, placed before an ornate fireplace, dominates the cavernous dining hall.			
632	60 1		60	Through the doorway Graham can see a small downstairs foyer.			
633	60 2		45	This doorway leads into a downstairs hallway.			
634	60 3		86	Four curious statues representing strange "birdmen" line two walls of the dining hall.			
635	60 5		54	Graham finds himself in Mordack's immense dining hall.			
636	60 4		70	Graham carefully examines the strange statues but sees nothing of use.			
637	61 0		71	Graham gapes at an odd figure of a bird-like, yet reptilian-like woman.			
638	61 2		56	Graham can see the huge dining hall through the doorway.			
639	61 3		56	Beyond an open doorway a set of stone steps lead upward.			
640	61 4		101	Graham looks in astonishment around this strange foyer filled with an assortment of bizarre oddities.			
641	61 1		70	Curiously, Graham looks at the strange figure but sees nothing of use.			
642	62 0		84	A huge monstrosity of a skull-like figure leers at passersby of an upstairs hallway.			
643	62 2		112	Graham looks out the spiked windows and views the distorted rocks and twisted forms of Mordack's strange island.			
644	62 3		42	This doorway leads into Mordack's bedroom.			
645	62 4		61	Graham can see into Mordack's laboratory through the doorway.			
646	62 5		47	The stairway leads down to a lower-level foyer.			
647	62 1		69	Graham looks up at the leering figure but sees nothing of any of use.			
648	63 0		64	A hot fire burns fiercely in the hideous fireplace near the bed.			
649	63 1		65	Mordack's wand lies temptingly upon the small table near his bed.			
650	63 2		65	A strange statue of a winged woman stands close to Mordack's bed.			
651	63 4		64	A large, grotesque bed occupies one corner of Mordack's bedroom.			
652	63 7		43	The doorway leads into an upstairs hallway.			
653	63 8		81	Graham surveys the bizarre furnishings and horrible figures in Mordack's bedroom.			
654	63 10		104	Graham looks out the window and views the distorted rocks and twisted forms of Mordack's strange island.			
655	63 5		56	It would not be a good idea to bother Mordack right now!			
656	63 6		65	The thought of lying on that horrible bed totally revolts Graham.			
657	(rm063 / rm065)		36	Poor Graham. Mordack shows no mercy.			
658	64 0		134	Many books and scrolls line the shelves of Mordack's library. As Graham looks them over, however, he finds them mostly unintelligible.			
659	64 2		63	Graham can see into Mordack's bedroom through the open doorway.			
660	64 3		71	Many book-filled shelves line the walls of Mordack's extensive library.			
661	64 4		71	A large tome lying open upon a corner desk attracts Graham's curiosity.			
662	64 5		79	Numerous books of various scholarly subjects lie scattered atop a nearby table.			
663	64 1		109	Since most of Mordack's books and scrolls are beyond Graham's comprehension he wisely decides to ignore them.			
664	64 6		131	The strange symbols have been burned into Graham's memory; there is no need to look at them again. Perhaps they'll be of use later.			
665	64 7	#time 6	68	Hmmmm, this looks interesting. Graham wonders what the symbols mean.			
666	64 8		47	None of these particular books interest Graham.			
667	65 1		105	A spiral staircase leads up to an upper balcony where a very bizarre machine captures Graham's curiosity.			
668	65 2		64	Graham can see part of the upstairs hallway through the doorway.			
669	65 3		75	Hot coals burn in an open-pit fireplace built at one end of the laboratory.			
670	65 5		110	Tears come to Graham's eyes as he sees his beloved family and castle held captive inside a large glass bottle.			
671	65 7		128	An odd machine of tubes, gears, weights, and tiny figures surrounding an unusual sphere-like object attracts Graham's curiosity.			
672	65 9		235	Graham has found himself in a large room filled with many unusual contraptions and magical implements. His heart feels like bursting when he notices his beloved family imprisoned within a large glass bottle sitting upon a corner table.			
673	65 0		180	Looking at his frantically waving family inside their glass prison causes Graham's heart to break as he realizes his current inability to save them from their terrible predicament.			
674	65 4		65	There is nothing but burning coals inside the open-pit fireplace.			
675	65 6		43	Graham can't get a clear view from up here.			
676	65 8		48	Graham will have to go up the stairs to do that.			
677	66 1		122	Mordack's wand now barely glows; perhaps its power has weakened while Crispin's old wand now appears completely energized.			
678	66 3		69	Atop the iron platter of the bizarre contraption lies Crispin's wand.			
679	66 4		65	Upon the iron platter of the strange machine lies Mordack's wand.			
680	66 6		84	Behind Mordack's strange machine lurk other baffling and curious magical implements.			
681	66 8		246	The strange device has returned to its original placid state, though Graham remains awestruck by the incredible display of power he has just witnessed. Mordack obviously is a wizard with extraordinary talents to have harnessed such amazing power.			
682	66 9		242	Graham has no idea what Mordack does with this strange contraption, but it couldn't be good! Inside the lower portion a foul-smelling liquid bubbles while two dangling spiked gizmos hang on a massive yoke above a couple of flat iron platters.			
683	66 5		80	Mordack's wand now looks dim and powerless. Graham has no desire for it anymore.			
684	66 7		46	Mordack's other gadgets don't interest Graham.			
685	66 10		141	The bizarre machine looks very intimidating and confusing which makes Graham reluctant to touch it; conversely though, it also intrigues him.			
686	66 0		66	Graham tosses the moldy cheese into the machine's bubbling liquid.			
687	66 2		71	The machine put on quite a show but didn't seem to accomplish anything!			
688	66 11		52	Graham hesitates. This may be the wrong thing to do.			
689	67 22		152	After observing no discernible escape route from the small cell, Graham sinks to the floor in despair, knowing he will never see the light of day again.			
690	(rm067)		35	Too bad! So close, yet so far away!			
691	67 7	#at -1 10	72	Graham can see a small, moldy piece of cheese just inside the mousehole.			
692	67 12	#at 40 40	44	Green mold covers the small piece of cheese.			
693	67 15		69	A stone block rests on the ground near a large hole in the cell wall.			
694	67 16		69	It looks like someone recently replaced and mortared the loose stone.			
695	67 19		63	Graham can see a tiny mousehole in one wall of the dreary cell.			
696	67 21		58	A fallen stone has revealed a large hole in the cell wall.			
697	67 23		75	Above him, Graham can see a damp, rusty grate leading to...who knows where?			
698	67 8	#at 40 40	83	Graham finds that his hand is too large to reach very far into the small mousehole.			
699	67 9	#at 40 40	81	Graham can't reach into the mousehole far enough to retrieve the piece of cheese.			
700	67 10	#at 40 40	114	Graham can ALMOST reach the piece of cheese inside the mousehole...but finds his hand too large to reach very far.			
701	67 17		47	The stone is much too heavy for Graham to lift.			
702	67 18		34	The stone can't be budged anymore.			
703	67 20		55	There is nothing more of interest inside the mousehole.			
704	67 24		65	The grate is too high up. There is nothing Graham can do with it.			
705	67 11	#at 40 40	95	There! Got it! The fishhook did the trick in retrieving the piece of cheese from the mousehole.			
706	67 13		23	That won't do any good.			
707	67 14		37	That implement won't quite work here.			
708	81 1		55	A small hole burrows in at the base of an immense tree.			
709	81 2		91	Graham has entered a secluded clearing in a quieter, more pleasant area of the dark forest.			
710	82 0		131	A narrow tunnel has been dug down into the ground. Weak sunlight brightens one end while a dim, eerie light beckons from the other.			
711	83 3		77	A tall wooden ladder reaches up toward the entrance of an underground tunnel.			
712	83 4		54	A lower opening leads into another underground tunnel.			
713	83 5		58	The little shoemaker elf has left and is nowhere in sight.			
714	83 7		100	Disappointingly, a deep chasm slices through the underground cavern cutting off further exploration.			
715	83 8		90	Graham can see no sign of the little elves previously working in the cavern's far reaches.			
716	83 10		105	The huge underground cavern seems to be a work area for a community of elves who have since abandoned it.			
717	83 6		86	The elf has gone and taken everything with him. There's nothing left of interest here.			
718	83 9		58	The elves have left and taken everything of use with them.			
719	(rm085)		30	That wasn't a very smart move!			
720	85 7		170	Graham notices three rough-looking men huddle over the bar in a serious conversation. Since they're talking in such low tones Graham can't quite hear what they're saying.			
721	85 9		48	A flea-bitten old dog lies asleep in the corner.			
722	85 12		70	Through an open doorway, Graham can see part of the inn's dining room.			
723	85 14		95	The country inn's tavern looks a bit shabby and run-down. At the bar, Graham notices three men.			
724	85 8		79	The three men haven't noticed Graham yet. Perhaps if he got a little closer....			
725	85 10		38	The dog is just out of Graham's reach.			
726	85 13		47	The inn's dining room is just a few steps away.			
727	85 11		44	Graham has nothing to say to a sleeping dog.			
728	85 15		67	Playing the harp has attracted the attention of the men at the bar.			
729	86 4		65	A small set of rickety, wooden stairs lead up to the cellar door.			
730	86 5		60	In one corner of the cellar, Graham notices a large rathole.			
731	86 7		87	Graham has unfortunately found himself locked in the country inn's dusty, dirty cellar.			
732	86 12		84	Lying in a heap on the stone floor, Graham sees the rope that once held him captive.			
733			0

765	212 3		43	Rocky cliffs rise high above Graham's head.

771	213 5		65	The two large rocks at the cliff base attract Graham's attention.			
772	213 7		103	Sheer rock cliffs rising straight up from the desert floor form an unreachable flat plateau at the top.			
773	213 9		68	A small pool of water has formed in the space between the two rocks.			
774	213 6		61	The rocks look interesting but too large to do anything with.

780	214 9		113	Carved into the rocky cliffs, an ancient temple towers above Graham as he surveys its ornate columns and friezes.			
781	214 10		60	The staff lies in several broken pieces on the temple steps.			
782	214 3		65	The temple door won't open. Perhaps there's something missing....			
783	214 6		76	Graham examines the statue carefully but doesn't see anything of importance.			
784	214 11		45	The staff is broken and is of no use anymore.

789	216 4		54	A large clay jar full of water stands by the campfire.			
790	(rm216)		78	The campfire, all but forgotten, has been reduced to a pile of glowing embers.			
791	(rm216)		72	The flaming campfire makes the oppressive heat of the desert even worse.			
792	216 6		99	The bandits' horses rest in the desert sun while their unsavory owners revel within the large tent.			
793	216 9		73	A lone camel waits near the large tent while its owner celebrates inside.			
794	216 12		141	Overhearing loud music and drunken laughter from within the larger tent, Graham guesses the bandits must be celebrating their latest plunder.			
795	216 13		72	Two tents sit silently in the desert apparently deserted for the moment.			
796	216 14		62	There doesn't seem to be any activity within the smaller tent.

803	216 7		56	Disturbing the horses would be very unwise at this time.			
804	216 10		52	The bandits would notice if the camel was disturbed.			
805	216 8		52	It wouldn't be smart to bother the horses right now.

853	200 1		142	To Graham's great relief, it appears that the witch's magic has been stopped by the amulet he is wearing, just as Madame Mushka said it would.			
854	200 11		174	Though she may look like an ancient old woman, this witch is really very powerful... and much too strong to be shoved aside by a mere man as she staunchly defends her bridge.

867	103 2	#at 10 130 #dispose	99	Why? Why would this wizard...Mordack...want my castle? What could he have against me and my family?

873	104 6	#at 140 100 #width 150 #dispose	88	The only problem is that Crispin is getting on in years and tends to be a bit forgetful.

939	92 5	#at 20 120 #width 270 #dispose	195	That was very lovely music. I've never heard anything quite that beautiful before. I think I felt my heart melting just a little bit. Just enough, that is, to allow you a chance for your freedom.

1035	205 12	#at 10 10 #time 9	118	Well, it ain't much, but it's all I've got to give. Here, take my cobbler's hammer. Perhaps you can find a use for it.

1081	96 3	#at 18 130 #width 250 #dispose	154	Naturally I refused and my father agreed with me. But our refusal angered him so much that he stole me here anyway, and put me to work as a scullery girl.

1086	120 3	#at 110 80 #dispose	261	He's dead, all right. He turned himself into a fire and I put him out with rainwater. He'll never bother anyone else EVER again! But now I have a bigger problem; I don't know what to do about my family or my castle. I don't know how to turn them back to normal!			
1087	120 4	#at 10 80 #dispose	51	After all you've been through, there MUST be a way!

1160	206 19	#at 8 8 #width 160 #time 7	66	(Laughing) Everybody has that problem! But what a problem to have!			
1161	206 20	#at 8 106 #width 160 #time 5	39	Those custard pies look most delicious.			
1162	206 21	#at 8 8 #width 160 #time 8	81	Yes. Made from a recipe handed down from our dear Mama...and her Mama before her.

1167	206 26	#at 8 106 #width 160 #time 6	36	I've got it right here. Here you go.			
1168	206 27	#at 8 106 #width 160 #time 5	20	Will a gold coin do?			
1169	206 28	#at 8 106 #width 160 #time 5	22	Will a gold needle do?			
1170	206 29	#at 8 106 #width 160 #time 5	23	Will a golden heart do?			
1171	206 30	#at 8 8 #width 160 #time 6	34	I hope you enjoy your custard pie.			
1172	206 31	#at 8 8 #width 160 #time 4	5	Sure!

1190	203 2	#at 10 10 #time 7	43	My golden needle! Wherever did you find it?			
1191	203 3	#at 10 10 #time 7	40	It was in a haystack by the country inn.			
1192	203 4	#at 10 10 #time 15	119	By the inn? Oh, yes. I remember visiting there not long ago. Oh, vulgar man, that innkeeper! He has no scruples at all.			
1193	203 5	#at 10 10 #time 7	57	Well, I'm glad to see you've got your golden needle back.			
1194	203 6	#at 10 10 #time 9	89	I wonder...could you possibly see fit to give me that wonderful cloak in exchange for it?			
1195	203 10	#at 10 10 #time 9	102	I would like to buy that fine cloak hanging in the corner. Will you take a lovely golden heart for it?			
1196	203 8	#at 10 10 #time 9	92	I would like to buy that fine cloak hanging in the corner. Will you take a gold coin for it?			
1197	203 7	#at 10 10 #time 10	72	The cloak? Well, why not. It's yours...for the price of a golden needle!			
1198	203 9	#at 10 10 #time 10	78	Why, yes. I guess a gold coin would be adequate. Here...let me get it for you.			
1199	203 11	#at 10 10 #time 10	96	This is a lovely piece! Of COURSE you may buy the cloak with this! Here...let me get it for you.

1203	203 15	#at 10 10 #time 7	83	Let me tell you... it will certainly keep you toasty warm during the coming winter.			
1204	203 16	#at 10 10 #time 5	34	Let me know if you wish to buy it.			
1205	203 28	#at 10 10 #time 5	40	I'm interested in buying something here.			
1206	203 29	#at 10 10 #time 5	32	Ah! Let me show you some things.			
1207	203 30	#at 10 100 #time 8	76	A fine piece of cloth. With this material I could make you beautiful shirts.			
1208	203 31	#at 10 100 #width 280 #time 14	131	There isn't a more beautiful piece of fabric to be found anywhere! With this, I could make you the finest trousers you've ever had.			
1209	203 32	#at 10 100 #time 5	24	Well, what do you think?			
1210	203 33	#at 100 100 #time 8	48	Well, right now I'm just looking. Thanks anyway.

1212	203 39	#at 20 20 #time 10	94	I would like to buy that fine cloak hanging in the corner. Will you take a silver coin for it?			
1213	203 40	#at 20 20 #time 10	85	A silver coin! You MUST be joking! That beautiful cloak is worth MUCH more than that!			
1214	203 41	#at 20 20 #time 8	56	I'm afraid I have nothing else in my shop at that price.			
1215	203 45	#at 20 20 #time 6	32	Here. Let me help you with that.			
1216	203 46	#at 20 20 #time 6	71	It's a fine cloak. It could be very useful to a traveler like yourself.			
1217	203 47	#at 20 20 #time 7	33	I hope you enjoy your fine cloak.			
1218	203 48	#at 20 20 #time 10	65	Oh no, that doesn't even begin to cover the cost of the material.			
1219	203 17	#at 40 10 #time 4 #dispose	25	I don't like THIS at all!			
1220	203 18	#at 40 10 #time 4 #dispose	27	You expect me to wear THIS!			
1221	203 19	#at 40 10 #time 5 #dispose	35	Why, these trousers don't even fit!			
1222	203 20	#at 40 10 #time 5 #dispose	40	This shirt's too tight in the shoulders!			
1223	203 21	#at 40 10 #time 4 #dispose	27	This isn't my style at all!			
1224	203 22	#at 40 10 #time 5 #dispose	42	Take these back. I don't like any of them.			
1225	203 23	#at 40 10 #time 4 #dispose	31	The sleeves aren't long enough!			
1226	203 24	#at 40 10 #time 5 #dispose	51	This material's too thin. I like something thicker.			
1227	203 25	#at 40 10 #time 5 #dispose	61	Now how am I supposed to get my boots on over these trousers?			
1228	203 26	#at 40 10 #time 4 #dispose	31	This tie isn't the right color.			
1229	203 27	#at 40 10 #time 4 #dispose	43	Here, take this. Let me try on another one.

1234	7 2	#at 10 10 #time 10	220	Why, yes...as a matter of fact, there is. I've been searching everywhere for my fiancee. She's a beautiful princess with long golden tresses, fetching blue eyes, and smooth, creamy skin. Have you seen her anywhere about?			
1235	7 3	#at 10 90 #time 4	43	No, sorry. I haven't seen anyone like that.			
1236	7 4	#at 10 10 #time 8	137	That's what I figured. No one has seen her. I bet that old witch who lives in the Dark Forest had something to do with her disappearance.			
1237	7 5	#at 10 90 #time 8	84	I'll keep an eye out for her. If I see her I'll let her know you're looking for her.
